# Example environment variables for Hostel Management System (Backend)
# DO NOT commit real secrets to the repository. For Render: set these in the
# service Environment settings (Dashboard) — do NOT store production secrets
# in Git.

# --- Database (MySQL) ---
# Use your managed MySQL host (Render, RDS, PlanetScale, ClearDB, etc.)
DB_NAME=hostel_management
DB_USER=hostel_user
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=your-db-hostname.example.com

# --- Application ---
# Port the app should bind to (Render will provide a port automatically,
# but keeping a default here is useful for local runs).
PORT=5000

# NODE environment (production|development|test)
NODE_ENV=production

# JWT secret used to sign tokens. Keep this long and random in production.
JWT_SECRET=replace_this_with_a_strong_random_secret

# Frontend URL (used to restrict CORS to your frontend domain)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Optional notes:
# - On Render, create a new Service (Web Service) pointing to this repo/branch.
# - Configure the above environment variables in the Render dashboard for the
#   service before deploying.
# - After the service is deployed (and the DB is accessible from the service),
#   run the migrations in the deployed environment:
#     1) Open a shell on the Render instance (Dashboard -> Shell) OR create a
#        one-off job.
#     2) Run: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` to apply migrations to the production DB.
# - Alternatively, run migrations as a separate Render Job or CI step prior to
#   routing traffic to the new release.
# - If you prefer running migrations automatically before the app starts,
#   update the Start Command for the Render service to:
#     `bash -lc "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate && node server.js"`
#   (Be cautious: auto-migrations can be risky during multi-instance deploys.)
